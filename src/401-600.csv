,Meow Wolf - House of Eternal Return,Venue,Santa Fe,NM,west,https://meowwolf.com/contact/, (505)395-6369,https://meowwolf.com,"Eliza Rickman played here. The small mountain town of Santa Fe hides a secret straight out of science fiction. An unassuming building in the city‰Ûªs industrial district is a nexus of colorful, chaotic portals that take explorers to worlds they‰Ûªve only seen in their wildest dreams.Meow Wolf‰Ûªs House of Eternal Return is a unique art experience featuring an astonishing new form of non-linear storytelling that unfolds through exploration, discovery and 21st century interactivity.The House is a 20,000 square foot art exhibit designed by the Meow Wolf collective. There are dozens of rooms, secret passages and interactive light and musical objects with which guests can play for hours or investigate the mystery of the Selig family, who disappeared one night after conducting a forbidden experiment inside their Victorian mansion. Who were the Seligs? Where did they go? and why is their home overrun by figures in white lab coats?The premise: Something has happened inside a mysterious Victorian house that has dissolved the nature of time and space. Venture through the house of The Selig Family and discover secret passageways into fantastic dimensions!This maximalist art and storytelling showcase is appropriate and engaging for guests of all ages. Experience what happens when art becomes everything you see, hear and touch. Be careful around the portals, though. They go everywhere‰Û_",,,,
