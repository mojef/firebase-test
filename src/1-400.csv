BOOKED US 4/18,Burdock,venue,Toronto,ON,Canada,"Charlotte: booking@burdockto.com",,https://www.facebook.com/BurdockBrewery/?hc_location=ufi,"Recommended by Abigail Rachel: ""Burdock has a nice ""listening room"" vibe with great sound and they're organized and nice to work with. They charge 20% of whatever you make at the door though. And while people like going to shows there (it's kind of a go-to spot) there's not necessarily any built-in crowd since the concert space is all separate from the rest of the building/restaurant (which, again, pros and cons since it's so nice and quiet). I'd probably get two local bands if you go this route. Anyway... maybe worth shooting an email to at least see about the date, and you can always go with another option."""
,Christa Couture,artist/band,Toronto,ON,Canada,christacouture@gmail.com,,,"Recommended by Abigail Rachel: ""great musician. She recently had a baby so might or might not be down to play but I thought the HH connection was worth noting (and she knows lots of folks)."""

You'd also be responsible for covering the $125 to book our sound tech for the evening and finding someone to collect at the door for you. All proceeds would go to you and the other bands, plus all musicians would be entitled to a couple of drink tickets and half priced meals before the show. The deposit covers full use of our PA."""

It seems that most Sofar shows happen on Tuesdays, so if that's something that might work in your schedule, it could be a great thing to consider. Like the Sofar shows here, they're not paid, but you usually get nice video and it would be great promo to work around other shows in your schedule, and is a great way to get introduced and connected into the CLE music scene. Regardless, Jeanette would be great to talk to for any other advice, recommendations, and just to connect with. She's great!"
